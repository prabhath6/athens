This avoids polluting browser markup with inline styles, provides clear abstractions for reasoning about components, and allows for style reuse.\r\n\")\r\n\r\n\r\n(defcard-doc \"\r\n  ## Creating Styles\r\n\r\n  It's helpful to distinguish style definitions from other types of definitions. Append `-style` to the name of your component when defining the style: `(def blocks-style)`, `(page-style)`.\r\n\r\n  Stylefy Styles are written as Clojure maps, so they should look familiar\r\n\r\n  ```clojure\r\n  (def button-style\r\n    {:cursor \\\"pointer\\\"\r\n     :padding \\\"6px 10px\\\"})\r\n  ```\r\n\")\r\n\r\n\r\n(defcard-doc \"\r\n  Style pseudo-elements and element modes with `::stylefy/mode` inside the style definition.\r\n\r\n  ```clojure\r\n  (def button-style\r\n    {:cursor \\\"pointer\\\"\r\n      :padding \\\"6px 10px\\\"\r\n      ::stylefy/mode [[:hover {:background-color \\\"blue\\\"}]\r\n                      [:after {:content \\\"''\\\"}]]})\r\n  ```\r\n\")\r\n\r\n\r\n(defcard-doc \"\r\n  Create styles for inner components with Stylefy's \\\"sub-styles\\\".
