An experiment in browsing the datascript database\r\n\r\n  You can use these devcards to explore the Athens datascript database.\r\n\r\n  Initial data:\r\n  - Start by loading initial data with the \\\"Load Real Data\\\" button.\r\n  - This will load some sample datoms from the ego.datoms file\r\n\r\n  Executing queries:\r\n  - The browse-box uses [sci](https://github.com/borkdude/sci) to execute datascript queries.\r\n  - In addition to the (non-side-effecting) clojure.core functions, the following bindings are available:\r\n  - `athens/db` -> the datascript connection, dereference (`@`) to get the current database value\r\n  - `d/q` -> for querying the database\r\n  - `d/pull` -> pull one or more attributes of an entity, returns a map\r\n  - `d/pull-many` -> like `d/pull`, but pulls many entities at once\r\n  - Execute the query by pressing `shift-enter`\r\n\r\n  Browsing:\r\n  - The browser is a simple html table translating the query result into rows and cells.\r\n  - Browsing is possible if you've used a pull expression (in a query or with `d/pull` or `d/pull-many`).\r\n  - If you click a link, it will generate a new query and evaluate it.\r\n\r\n  History:\r\n  - Devcards keeps a history for us. Use the arrows at the bottom to navigate back to earlier states.\r\n\r\n  Possible improvements:\r\n  - Right now navigation is only possible by using a pull expression. By analysing queries it might also be possible for all other queries.\r\n  - No transctions are currently allowed, but this can easily be changed by adding `d/transact` to sci's bindings.\r\n  - There is absolutely no styling, some minimal styling would probably make reading the table easier.\r\n  \")\r\n\r\n\r\n(def initial-box\r\n  {:str-content\r\n   \"(d/q '[:find [(pull ?e [*]) ...]\r\n       :where [?e :node/title]]\r\n    @athens/db)\"})\r\n\r\n\r\n(defonce box-state*\r\n  (r/atom initial-box))\r\n\r\n\r\n(defn eval-box\r\n  [{:keys [str-content] :as box}]\r\n  (let [bindings {'athens/db db/dsdb\r\n                  'd/q d/q\r\n                  'd/pull d/pull\r\n                  'd/pull-many d/pull-many}\r\n        [ok? result] (try\r\n                       [true (sci/eval-string str-content {:bindings bindings})]\r\n                       (catch js/Error e [false e]))]\r\n    (-> box\r\n        (assoc :result result)\r\n        (assoc :error (not ok?)))))\r\n\r\n\r\n(defn eval-box!\r\n  []\r\n  (swap! box-state* eval-box))\r\n\r\n\r\n(defn update-box!\r\n  [s]\r\n  (swap! box-state* assoc :str-content s))\r\n\r\n\r\n(defn update-and-eval-box!\r\n  [s]\r\n  (swap! box-state*\r\n         #(-> %\r\n              (assoc :str-content s)\r\n              (eval-box))))\r\n\r\n\r\n(defn load-real-db!\r\n  [conn]\r\n  (go\r\n    (let [res (<!
